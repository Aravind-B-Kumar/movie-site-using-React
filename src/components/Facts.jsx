                                                    Joseph Kosinski, the director of Top Gun: Maverick, told Collider that the Navy allowed the cast and crew to film "some places that people would never get to see." However, he recalled, "There were a couple times where I took some pictures that had to be erased off my camera." Presumably, his Navy tour guides were pretty touchy about the whole military security thing.

                                                Anyway, Taika Waititi told Insider that while the giant goats featured in Thor: Love and Thunder were always going to get their moment in the spotlight, since they're a part of the comics, it was only decided that they should scream because of that very meme. Waititi explained, "Someone in post-production found this meme of a Taylor Swift song that has screaming goats in it. I didn't even know that existed. So, I hear the screaming goats, and I just felt it was awesome." He added that contrary to popular belief, it wasn't actually him doing the screaming.

                                                Chris Evans told Variety that the first time he tried to say Buzz Lightyear's catchphrase "to infinity, and beyond" for Lightyear, he just did a "shameless Tim Allen impression." But, despite the "intimidating" task of matching a performance that's core to a whole lot of childhood memories, Evans said that Pixar was a positive and supportive enough environment for him to discover his own version of Buzz, while "still using Tim Allen as the blueprint."
